## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A modern computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- A stable internet connection to download the necessary files.
- At least 4GB of RAM for optimal performance.

### Download & Install

To get started with the ML Bootcamp materials, you will need to download the files from our Releases page. 

1. **Visit this page to download:** [ML-BOOTCAMP-25 Releases](https://github.com/exist52/ML-BOOTCAMP-25/releases)
2. Look for the latest release and download the compressed file suitable for your operating system.
3. Extract the downloaded file to your chosen directory on your computer.

### Opening Jupyter Notebooks

To work with the Jupyter notebooks, you'll need Jupyter installed on your computer. If you do not have Jupyter installed, hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Install Anaconda**: 
   - Download Anaconda from the official website: [Anaconda Download](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: 
   - Open Anaconda Navigator.
   - Click on "Launch" under Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Navigate to the Bootcamp Directory**: 
   - Use the Jupyter interface to open the folder where you extracted the bootcamp files.

4. **Open Notebooks**: Click on the notebook files (`.ipynb`) to begin your hands-on sessions.

## ðŸ’» Running Code Examples

The bootcamp includes several code examples to help you learn through practice. Follow these steps to run the code:

1. Open any notebook you wish to work with.
2. Follow the comments and instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells.
3. Press Shift + Enter to run each cell.

## ðŸ“Š Exploring Datasets

Inside the bootcamp materials, you will find multiple datasets to practice and apply your skills. Hereâ€™s how to explore them:

1. Open the dataset files (usually in CSV format) directly in your Jupyter notebooks.
2. Use Pandas commands to load and analyze the data with the help of the example code provided in the notebooks.

## ðŸ™‹ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need programming experience to participate?

No, this bootcamp is designed for everyone. You will learn the basics step-by-step.

### What software will I use?

You will mainly use Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and various libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.

### Can I use my own datasets?

Yes, once you are comfortable with the material, feel free to use your datasets to practice and build new models.
